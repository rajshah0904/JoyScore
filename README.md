# JoyScore
A member of our group indicated that they often get YouTube recommendations solely based on what videos they've clicked on, even videos they don't like and wouldn't appreciate similar recommendations for. To counteract the slight inefficiency in video recommendations, we decided to create a product that allows for more accurate suggestions to aid the existing YouTube recommendation algorithm. JoyScore scans the user's face at frequent intervals throughout the duration of the video and determines a quantified value of the user's emotions at each interval. Then, it combines the values of the emotions to create a weighted average of their emotions, which represents their sentiment score. Last, it determines a qualitative value ranging from "Very Strongly Recommend" to "Very Strongly Do Not Recommend", upon which the YouTube Search Algorithm can use the information to aid in its recommendations.
